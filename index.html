    <h3 class = "num1">Intro to HTML/CSS:</h3>
    <p class = "num1">Intro to HTML/CSS is a computer programming course available on Khan Academy. 
      This course teches students how to read and code in the HTML and CSS coding language. This portfolio was created using both HTML and CSS.</p>
    <h3 class = "num2">Intro to JS:</h3>
    <p class = "num2">This is a Khan Academy course that teaches students how to code and interpret code in the javascript language. 
      Javascript is a computer programming language used worldwide for websites, mobile and browser apps and game development. 
      Projects such as the ad design project could be integrated into websites to create objects and shapes that could not be created using HTML or CSS.</p>
    <h3 class = "num3">Games and Visualizations:</h3>
    <p class = "num3">Games and visualizations is a javascript course on Khan Academy that teaches students how to create interactive projects using javascript. 
      This is a good starting point for anyone who is thinking of becoming a game developer. 
      The project hoppy beaver extreme is a good example of a beginner project that will serve as a starting point for aspiring game developers.</p>
    <h3 class = "num4">Natural Simulations:</h3>
    <p class = "num4">The natural simulations course on Khan Academy is a course that teaches students how to make natural simulations of particles and creature behaviour. 
      This course also allows students to simulate more natural pseudorandomness than what they were capable of doing before. 
      For example, the creature colonies project can teach students how to give particles lifetimes and how to simulate them naturally.</p>
    <h3 class = "num5">AP Programming:</h3>
    <p class = "num5">AP programming is a course on Khan Academy that is different than the other Khan Academy courses listed above. This course is less interactive than the previous courses but is more informative than the others. 
      The AP programming course gives an abridged version of the lessons that were learned so far and expands on them with broader knowledge of programming and pseudocode. 
      The importance of pseudocode is that it is much easier to write and read and helps people to conceptualize code easier.It is also helpful to have the lessons summarized in a few sentences.</p>
