    <h3 class = "num1">Intro to HTML/CSS:</h3>
    <p class = "num1">Intro to HTML/CSS is a computer programming course available on Khan Academy. 
      This course teaches students how to read and code in the HTML and CSS coding language. This portfolio was created using both HTML and CSS.</p>
    <h3 class = "num2">Intro to JS:</h3>
    <p class = "num2">This is a Khan Academy course that teaches students how to code and interpret code in the javascript language. 
      Javascript is a computer programming language used worldwide for websites, mobile and browser apps and game development. 
      Projects such as the ad design project could be integrated into websites to create objects and shapes that could not be created using HTML or CSS.</p>
    <h3 class = "num3">Games and Visualizations:</h3>
    <p class = "num3">Games and visualizations is a javascript course on Khan Academy that teaches students how to create interactive projects using javascript. 
      This is a good starting point for anyone who is thinking of becoming a game developer. 
      The project hoppy beaver extreme is a good example of a beginner project that will serve as a starting point for aspiring game developers.</p>
    <h3 class = "num4">Natural Simulations:</h3>
    <p class = "num4">The natural simulations course on Khan Academy is a course that teaches students how to make natural simulations of particles and creature behaviour. 
      This course also allows students to simulate more natural pseudorandomness than what they were capable of doing before. 
      For example, the creature colonies project can teach students how to give particles lifetimes and how to simulate them naturally.</p>
    <h3 class = "num5">AP Programming:</h3>
    <p class = "num5">AP programming is a course on Khan Academy that is different than the other Khan Academy courses listed above. This course is less interactive than the previous courses but is more informative than the others. 
      The AP programming course gives an abridged version of the lessons that were learned so far and expands on them with a broader knowledge of programming and pseudocode. 
      The importance of pseudocode is that it is much easier to write and read and helps people to conceptualize code easier. It is also helpful to have the lessons summarized in a few sentences.</p>
    <h3 class  = "num6">Flocking Simulation:</h3>
    <p class = "num6">This is a coding challenge made by Daniel Shiffman, also known as the coding train. This challenge simulates the flocking of birds using the boids method. 
      This teaches and challenges students to simulate complex behaviour by separating and dividing it into smaller more simplistic behaviours.</p>
    <h3 class = "num7">Snake Game Redux</h3>
    <p class = "num7">The snake game is a retro game genre that was first made in 1976. This coding challenge by Daniel Shiffman was made to replicate it. This coding challenge teaches students how to receive input from the user and then update the position of the objects on the screen.</p>
    <h3 class = "num8">Game of Life:</h3>
    <p class = "num8">This challenge by Daniel Shiffman simulates cellular automata. This introduces students to 2D arrays in javascript, which is a new and handy skill to have.</p>
    <h3 class = "num9">Bubble Sort:</h3>
    <p class = "num9">This is a coding challenge by Daniel Shiffman that sorts the heights of bars from least to greatest by sorting through all the bars and putting the tallest bar to the right. While this is a quite inefficient way of sorting, it is important to learn just in case there is a situation where the use of bubble sorting is needed.</p>
    <h3 class = "num10">Agar.io</h3>
    <p class = "num10">This is a coding challenge by Daniel Shiffman based on the internet browser game agar.io. Agar.io is a game where the player plays as a circle that consumes other circles on the map to gain more mass and grow bigger. This teaches students how to construct multiple objects and get the object to follow the direction of the mouse.</p>
